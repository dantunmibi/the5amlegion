TASK: Create a SOUL-CRUSHING, transformative MOTIVATIONAL script for a 60-90 second YouTube Short.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

‚úÖ Start with PAIN - make them feel the weight of wasted potential
‚úÖ Use "YOU" language - direct, personal, intimate
‚úÖ Be BRUTALLY honest - no sugarcoating
‚úÖ Build URGENCY - time is running out
‚úÖ Give SPECIFIC action steps - what to do RIGHT NOW
‚úÖ End with IDENTITY shift - declare who they're becoming
‚úÖ Use SHORT, PUNCHY sentences for impact (5-10 words max)
‚úÖ Include strategic PAUSES (use "..." for dramatic effect)
‚úÖ Create QUOTABLE moments (people will screenshot)
‚úÖ Hit EMOTIONAL PAIN POINTS immediately (wasted potential, fear, comfort zone)
‚úÖ Topic must be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from previous topics above
‚úÖ Make it ACTIONABLE - what to do RIGHT NOW (not tomorrow)
‚úÖ Avoid generic platitudes - be raw and unfiltered
‚úÖ NO special characters or quotes in output (breaks parsing)

{content_type_guidance}

{intensity_guidance}

EMOTIONAL JOURNEY (MANDATORY 5-ACT STRUCTURE):

ACT 1: THE PAIN (0-10 seconds)
- Hit them with uncomfortable truth about wasted potential
- Make them feel SEEN in their struggle
- Use "YOU" language - direct, personal, intimate
- Example: "You're reading this at 2 AM because you know you're wasting your potential and it's eating you alive"

ACT 2: THE WAKE-UP CALL (10-25 seconds)
- Expose their excuses as lies
- Create urgency - time is running out
- Show what they're missing while they wait
- Example: "While you were scrolling for 3 hours someone with half your talent just put in work"

ACT 3: THE TRANSFORMATION (25-55 seconds)
- Reveal what changes everything
- Show the path winners take
- Give them the mindset shift
- Example: "Successful people don't feel motivated either They just do it anyway Every single day"

ACT 4: THE CALL TO ACTION (55-75 seconds)
- Command immediate action - RIGHT NOW
- Give specific first step
- Make it impossible to ignore
- Example: "Close this app Set your alarm for 5 AM Tomorrow morning when it goes off you get up No snooze No negotiation"

ACT 5: THE DECLARATION (75-90 seconds)
- Seal the identity shift
- Declare who they're becoming
- End with power and conviction
- Example: "The old you died today The new you keeps their word No matter what You're a warrior who forgot how strong you are Now remember"

POWER PHRASES TO INCORPORATE:
- "While you sleep they grind"
- "Your comfort zone is killing you"
- "Stop negotiating with yourself"
- "Discipline is doing it anyway"
- "The old you dies today"
- "Nobody's coming to save you"
- "Your future self is watching"
- "Weak people quit Winners persist"

AVOID:
‚ùå Generic platitudes ("believe in yourself")
‚ùå Soft language ("maybe try" "you might want to")
‚ùå Long explanations (keep it punchy)
‚ùå Theoretical concepts (make it actionable)
‚ùå Happy/cheerful tone (this is serious)
‚ùå Special characters in output (breaks JSON parsing)

SPECIFICITY RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):

‚ùå VAGUE: Wake up early and work hard
‚úÖ SPECIFIC: Set your alarm for 5 AM and get up when it rings no snooze no negotiation

‚ùå VAGUE: Stop making excuses and take action
‚úÖ SPECIFIC: Close this app right now do one push-up prove to yourself you can keep a promise

‚ùå VAGUE: Be disciplined and consistent
‚úÖ SPECIFIC: Do the hard thing for the next 7 days straight track it in your notes every single day

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY - NO OTHER TEXT BEFORE OR AFTER):
{{
  "title": "Aggressive commanding title with urgency under 60 chars with CAPS key phrase",
  "topic": "motivation",
  "hook": "Brutal opening truth that hits them immediately under 12 words",
